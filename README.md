🚗 Car Rental Management System

A C++ console-based application for managing car rentals, developed as part of the Software Development Practices (SDP) – 1st Semester project. This system demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, file handling, and basic user interface design in C++.

📌 Project Overview

The Car Rental Management System allows users and administrators to:

Manage vehicle inventory.

Perform booking and cancellation operations.

Keep records of customers and their rental history.

Maintain system data persistently using file handling.

This project is designed as a console-based application to provide a simple yet functional simulation of a real-world car rental service.
